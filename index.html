                <h3>Butternut Squash, Chilli and Coconut Milk Soup</h3>
                <p>This soup is so warming, comforting and rich! It has sweet roasted butternut squash tones, mellowed
                    by coconut milk and nicely spiced by chilli. In fact, it calls for both fresh chilli pepper and
                    chilli infused olive oil.</p>

                <h3>The Vegan Diet</h3>
                <p>In the recent years vegan diet has caught the attention of almost everyone. People have decided to go
                    vegan for ethical, environmental or health reasons. A vegan diet contains only plants (such as
                    vegetables, grains, nuts and fruits) and foods made from plants.
